# Gaia Project Timer

A mobile-based game timer for the board game Gaia Project.

## Overview

(This readme shamelessly copied from
[Timer Mystica](https://github.com/dphilipson/timer-mystica).)

Gaia Project is a great board game! But if you're anything like me, sometimes
you want to play a game where everyone doesn't take forever for their turns.
This app will help keep your friends in line.

Gaia Project Timer runs on a phone and keeps track of turn order as well as how much
time each player has taken. It understands the variable turn order rules of
Gaia Project so you can rely on it to keep track of who should be going at any
given time. By tracking how much time each player has used, you can make your
friends take shots every seven minutes, or just make fun of them for being
slow.

## Installation

Gaia Project Timer is a website designed to be viewed as a full screen app on a
mobile device. To start using it, follow these steps:

1. On your mobile device, view the app at
   <http://dphilipson.github.io/gaia-project-timer>.

2. Save the page to your homescreen.

3. Open the page from your homescreen to get a fullscreen view.

4. It is recommended to lock rotation on your device while using this app. It
   only really works in portrait orientation so this will reduce some minor
   annoyances.

## Use

On the initial screen, select which factions are in the game and press the
button to start the game. In the game, on each players turn hand the mobile
device to that player. When they are done, they should press either "Pass" or
"Next Player" and then hand the mobile device to the player whose turn is next.
"Pass" indicates that the player is passing for the round, while "Next Player"
indicates that they are merely done with their turn.

The buttons at the top give some control over the timing. The Pause button
stops the clock from running until it is pressed again to resume. The Undo
button moves back through the turn history, which is particularly useful when a
player accidentally presses "Pass" instead of "Next" or vice versa.

## Dev Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    rlwrap lein figwheel dev test

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

You can run the tests by opening your browser at
[localhost:3449/test.html](http://localhost:3449/test.html). The test results
are shown in the console and in the color of the favicon, and are automatically
re-run whenever the source changes.

If `rlwrap` is not installed, then it can be omitted from the above command,
but you will lose some command line conveniences like history and arrow
navigation.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
